Getting-and-Cleaning-data-project
=================================
This  repo  contains all the elements required for the submission of the getting and cleaning  data project.
##Introduction
The objective of this project is to show proficiency in collecting, cleaning and working with data in order to get tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data  used in this project comes from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

you can download the data for this project from the following link : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
## Project description
The  script  created ("run_analysis.R") does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Additional Information
In this repo there is a a code book where you can find detailed information about  the variables, data and all the transformations performed to clean up the data and briefly explanation about  the procedure followed to get tidy data from its source.
DonÂ´t forget to set your working directory with the location of the source file in your own directory to run the script.
